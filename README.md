# shortlist_gender_stats

A list of shortlisted candidates from the Astorbetter Rumor Mill. So far, I've only included the candidate's last name, gender, and year of Ph.D, all separated with spaces (shortlist.ascii).

I hastily put this together just by Googling people and finding their gender + year of Ph.D. I can't guarantee that no mistakes or typos were made. Therefore, I encourage you to update/modify this list.
